# Musysic-MU.MIDI4c
Adding MIDI mapping for Musysic 4 deck mixer 
also known as #Musysic MiDi6 unit
     So far the developer has supplied me a generic nonfunctioning ASIO driver that is not recognised with any DJ software platform even VirtualDJ that it was supplied with. It has solid construction spec as followed:
     5V S/N self powered; >75dB frequency ratio; 20Hz-20KHz +-3dB response; <0.1% THD.
     Dimension(WxDxH) 624x306x86 mm
My plan is to write a replacement MIDI.script before my manufactures warrenty voids Nov2016. If i succeed i plan to be the first to write a functioning overview.
then i will party hard, hashtag turnup
